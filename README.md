## Instructions

1. you can use Postman as a client to make a POST query in the format below,
    http://localhost:3000/api/update/:commands?commands=["place 0,1,NORTH", "MOVE"]
2. When you use PLACE key, it ignores previous co-ordinates and places your robot to the specified co-ordinates.
3. MOVE key will move your Robot by one unit in the direction it faces. In the example above, it is facing NORTH.
4. You can also use REPORT key in the place of MOVE, which will provide co-ordinates and orientatio of the report.
5. when you don't provide orientation like, NORTH in the example above, it defaults to NORTH.
